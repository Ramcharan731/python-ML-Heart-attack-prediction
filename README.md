# python-ML-Heart-attack-prediction
Heart attack prediction using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) is a rapidly evolving field in healthcare that aims to identify individuals at risk of a heart attack before it occurs. This approach leverages large datasets, sophisticated algorithms, and computing power to analyze a wide range of factors that contribute to heart disease.
